But after opening the capsule that came out, a ghostly creature named Whisper materialises. Whisper, who was sealed inside the capsule, rewards his liberator Keita by becoming his Yo-kai butler and gives him a Yo-kai Watch. Whoever wears the watch gains the ability to see supernatural creatures called Yo-kai, each type possessing different kinds of magical abilities, and which are normally invisible to humans. The Yo-kai Watch also allows the wearer to summon any Yo-kai they have befriended, enabling the wearer to make use of the Yo-kai's powers. Using it, Keita and Whisper encounter many mischievous Yo-kai around town, resolving the trouble they're causing and befriending many at the same time.\n","synonyms":[{"text":"Yo-Kai Watch"},{"text":"Yokai Watch"}],"series":[{"slug":"youkai_watch","name":"Youkai Watch"}],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Geragerapou no Uta","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-36, 51","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Matsuri Hayashi de Geragerapou","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP3","song":{"title":"Hatsukoi-touge de Geragerapou","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-OP3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP4","song":{"title":"Kerappo Dance Train","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"63-76","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-OP4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP5","song":{"title":"Jinsei Dramatic","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"77-101","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-OP5","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Idol wa Unyanya no Ken","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"youkai_watch"},"entries":[{"episodes":"51-67","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoukaiWatch-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/19157/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/19157/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/youkai-watch","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/9930","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6411"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6412"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"youkai_watch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
