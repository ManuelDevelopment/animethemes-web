His dragon has never appeared.\n<br><br>\nUntil now, that is. One fateful day, Ash's dragon awakes in full glory, but appears different than any dragon ever seen before—in the form of a beautiful girl! What's worse, Ash soon discovers that this new dragon has attitude to spare, as she promptly informs him that she is the master, and he, the servant.\n<br>\nAsh's problems with dragon riding have only just begun.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[{"text":"Dragonar Academy"},{"text":"Seikoku no Ryuukishi"}],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Seiken nante Iranai","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yui_sakakibara","name":"Yui Sakakibara"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikoku_no_dragonar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikokuNoDragonar-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"MOST Ijou no 'MOSTEST'","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ayane_sakura","name":"Ayane Sakura"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"marina_inoue","name":"Marina Inoue"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"mariya_ise","name":"Mariya Ise"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikoku_no_dragonar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-6","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikokuNoDragonar-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"MOST Ijou no 'MOSTEST'","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"asuka_oogame","name":"Asuka Oogame"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"kana_hanazawa","name":"Kana Hanazawa"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikoku_no_dragonar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"7-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikokuNoDragonar-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"MOST Ijou no 'MOSTEST'","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"asuka_oogame","name":"Asuka Oogame"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"ayane_sakura","name":"Ayane Sakura"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"kana_hanazawa","name":"Kana Hanazawa"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"marina_inoue","name":"Marina Inoue"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"mariya_ise","name":"Mariya Ise"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikoku_no_dragonar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikokuNoDragonar-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"BD1080"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21033/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/20592/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/seikoku-no-dragonar","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/9996","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5009"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5010"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"seikoku_no_dragonar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
