But since there's no jet racing in Rin's remote fishing village, that means moving, all by herself, to a girls' school in faraway Tokyo!<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, Misa Aoi dreamed of becoming a great player, but those ambitions floundered until Rin transferred to her school, displaying astonishing skill for a newcomer. Is it fate? Now they \"only\" have to resurrect their school's Jet Riding Club, endure brutal training, and face some seriously skilled rivalsâ€¦ but even the toughest tasks are easier when you're doing something you love with someone who's quickly becoming far more than just a friend!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"BULLET MERMAID","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"kandagawa_jet_girls"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"RIVALS","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"azusa_tadokoro","name":"Azusa Tadokoro"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"kandagawa_jet_girls"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-3, 5","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]},{"episodes":"4, 6, 11-12","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-ED1v2-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]},{"episodes":"7-10","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"KandagawaJetGirls-ED1v3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40196/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/110810/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kandagawa-jet-girls","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/15024","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2855"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2856"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kandagawa_jet_girls"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
