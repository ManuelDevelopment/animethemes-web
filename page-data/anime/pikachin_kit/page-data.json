One day Eiji finds a mysterious book called the \"Pikachin Research Book,\" and learns about the seven tools that make up the Pikachin Kit. Eiji presses a button inside the research book, and immediately a \"Future Amazon\" delivery arrives at his door with the kit. Eiji uses the blueprints included in the box to assemble the kit, but it seems as though 1% part of the kit is still missing. <br><br>\n\nIn the franchise, the word \"Pikachin\" means the flash of inspiration or insight one gets about a new project, similar to the visual of a lightbulb turning on above one's head when someone has an idea. The concept of the franchise is \"invention is 99% plastic models, 1% inspiration.\"\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[{"text":"Pochitto Hatsumei: Pikachin-Kit"}],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Poka☆Chin Time","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-65","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"bring back","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"},"entries":[{"episodes":"66-115","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Poka☆Chin Time","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13, 66-115","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Dracaena","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-65","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36552/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/100910/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/pikachin-kit","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/13514","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4501"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4502"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
