Even though he doesn't want to go, he agrees to do so when his mother offers him a mountain bike. Ayumu used to live in Tana before, and now his memories of the time are shrouded in mystery - apparently something happened when he was a child. Enter Miku, a young girl who knows more than she tells, weird glowing lights floating around, reflections of UFOish objects in the eyes of cats and dogs, a nosy female announcer, a forest with a mysterious past, and a weird boy called Wakkun, who wears the clothes Ayumu used to when he was a child, and you get the world of Zettai Shonen, where mysteries remain mysteries amidst a slow, normal, everyday life.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Hikari no Silhouette","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"coorie","name":"CooRie"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"zettai_shounen"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ZettaiShounen-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]},{"episodes":"14-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"ZettaiShounen-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Shounen Humming","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"masumi_itou","name":"Masumi Itou"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"zettai_shounen"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ZettaiShounen-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/308/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/308/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/zettai-shounen","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/2837","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6575"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6576"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"zettai_shounen"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
