Unfortunately, Yurine does not actually know how to send Jashin-chan back to Hell. Now stuck on Earth, she must live at Yurine's apartment as her familiar.<br>\n<br>\nThe only way for Jashin-chan to return would be to kill her summoner, but this is easier said than done for the incompetent demon. Since Jashin-chan is immortal and can regenerate her body, Yurine does not hold back in attacking her with a range of weapons, punishing her in gruesome manners for her evil schemes. Jashin-chan is also often visited by her demon friends: the kindhearted Gorgon Medusa and the energetic minotaur Minosu, who seem much more well-behaved in contrast, and disapprove of her plans to kill Yurine.<br><br>\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","synonyms":[{"text":"Dropkick On My Devil!!"},{"text":"Jyashin-chan Dropkick"},{"text":"False God My Dropkick"}],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Anoko ni Drop Kick","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aina_suzuki","name":"Aina Suzuki"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"jashin_chan_dropkick"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"JashinChanDropkick-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"JashinChanDropkick-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Home Sweet Home!","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"jashin_chan_dropkick"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"JashinChanDropkick-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"JashinChanDropkick-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36906/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/100714/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/jashin-chan-dropkick","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/13637","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2617"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2618"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"jashin_chan_dropkick"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
