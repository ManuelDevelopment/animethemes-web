The rich seek to satisfy their desires and derive pleasure for themselves, and Tokyo has materialized into such a city as a result. Saiga, once a war photographer, works for Hibara Ginza in the capitalist state of Tokyo. He infiltrates the Roppongi Club, a secretive base located in the red light district of the city, to collect information about them. However, he was caught in the process and brought forward to a girl called Kagura who was in the midst of a ritual. His contact with Kagura awakens his special ability: the power to make things explode when photographed. In order to unravel the mystery behind the Roppongi Club and Kagura, Saiga begins his solitary battle.","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Girls on Film","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"speed_grapher"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-11","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SpeedGrapher-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]},{"episodes":"12-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"SpeedGrapher-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Hinageshi no Oka","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"speed_grapher"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SpeedGrapher-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Break the Cocoon","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"speed_grapher"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SpeedGrapher-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD576"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/198/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/198/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/speed-grapher","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/2696","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5479"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5480"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"speed_grapher"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
