To alter your perceptions, see things that aren't there, and remember events that never happened? You could drive off a cliff believing that you were still on the road, or commit murder without knowing what you had done. Now imagine being one of the people born with this ability. Knowing how easily our entire world can be taken apart, would you accept orders to manipulate others?<br>\n<br>\nThat's the conundrum that Hiroki, Satoru and Tsukasa find themselves in as they're employed as psychic hitmen and enforcers by a mysterious agency. Or, at least, that's what might be happening. Because they themselves are almost certainly being manipulated, and the concepts of truth and reality cease to have meaning when you're one of the terrifying beings known as a pet.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Chou no Tobu Suisou","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"tk","name":"TK"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"pet"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Pet-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"Pet-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"image _____","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"pet"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Pet-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"},{"filename":"Pet-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":null,"subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":""}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37522/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/101350/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/pet","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/13947","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4481"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4482"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
