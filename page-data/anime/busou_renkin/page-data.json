However, he soon finds out that dream wasn't a dream at all when a giant serpentine monster attacks him and his sister. Tokiko Tsumura, the girl he saved, explains that the monster is a homunculus. Kazuki had been attacked and killed by it when he was rescuing her. However, she, feeling responsible for him, revived him by placing a Kakugane medallion in his chest, serving as a replacement heart.<br><br>\nThe Kakugane, as Tokiko explains, is an alchemical device that, when activated, takes a certain form based on the Kakugane's user, forming a unique Buso Renkin. The Buso Renkin is the only thing that can destroy a homunculus monster. Using this, Kazuki creates his own Buso Renkin (the \"Sunlight Heart\", a huge lance). Along with Tokiko and her own Buso Renkin (the \"Valkyrie Skirt\", an execution scythe), Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculi and their master.","synonyms":[{"text":"Arms Alchemy"},{"text":"Buso Renkin"},{"text":"BoRe"},{"text":"BuRe"}],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Makka na Chikai","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"busou_renkin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BusouRenkin-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"BusouRenkin-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Hoshi Akari","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"busou_renkin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-14, 26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BusouRenkin-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"BusouRenkin-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Itoshiki Sekai","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"busou_renkin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"15-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BusouRenkin-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"DVD480"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1536/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1536/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/busou-renkin","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/4516","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/763"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/764"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"busou_renkin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
