Robin, a 15 year old craft user, arrives from Italy to Japan to work for an organization named STN Japan Division (STN-J) as a replacement for one of STN-J's witch hunters who was recently killed. Unlike other divisions of STN, STN-J tries to capture the witches alive in order to learn why and how they became witches in the first place.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Shell","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"witch_hunter_robin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"WitchHunterRobin-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"half pain","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"witch_hunter_robin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"WitchHunterRobin-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCDVD480"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/7/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/witch-hunter-robin","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/96","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6257"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6258"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"witch_hunter_robin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
