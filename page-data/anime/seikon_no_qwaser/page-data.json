Alexander Nikolaevith Hell is an Iron Qwaser, one of many opposing factions of super-warriors who can each draw upon the power of an element and wield it as an almost unstoppable array of weapons. And unfortunately for Mafuyu, Alexander's faction is there to gather the mystical relics known collectively as the High Circuit, which puts her friends, family and school at ground zero in a battle for the fate of all mankind! But there's an even more disturbing twist, as Qwasers require a special liquid diet to manifest their powers, one provided by the women who serve as a Qwaser's partner. And THAT means that the nursing Mafuyu's already given Alexander isn't the only kind of nursing he needs! <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":[{"text":"The Qwaser of Stigmata"}],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Errand","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"faylan","name":"Faylan"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12, 24","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Baptize","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yousei_teikoku","name":"Yousei Teikoku"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-18","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]},{"episodes":"19-24","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-OP2v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Passionate squall","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aki_toyosaki","name":"Aki Toyosaki"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"aya_hirano","name":"Aya Hirano"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"minori_chihara","name":"Minori Chihara"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"yoko_hikasa","name":"Yoko Hikasa"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-4, 6-12","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Mimei no Inori","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"minori_chihara","name":"Minori Chihara"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"},"entries":[{"episodes":"5","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Wishes Hypocrites","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aki_toyosaki","name":"Aki Toyosaki"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"aya_hirano","name":"Aya Hirano"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"minori_chihara","name":"Minori Chihara"},"as":null},{"artist":{"slug":"yoko_hikasa","name":"Yoko Hikasa"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-23","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SeikonNoQwaser-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD1080"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6500/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/6500/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/seikon-no-qwaser","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/6816","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5011"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5012"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"seikon_no_qwaser"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
