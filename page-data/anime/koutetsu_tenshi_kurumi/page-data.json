While the Imperial Army wanted to use the Steel Angel as a new means of modern warfare, Ayanokoji wanted his creation to be a new step in the future of mankind. Thus, he defied orders from the Army and secretly made the Steel Angel codenamed \"Kurumi\". Then one day, a young boy named Nakahito Kagura snuck into Ayanokoji's house as a dare by his friends and stumbled upon Kurumi's lifeless body. A sudden attack by the Imperial Army shook the house, causing Kurumi to fall on Nakahito. At that moment, their lips met, and Kurumi woke up from \"the kiss that started a miracle\".\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[{"text":"Steel Angel Kurumi"}],"series":[{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi","name":"Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi"}],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoutetsuTenshiKurumi-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Eien no Koutetsu Tenshi","performances":[]},"anime":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoutetsuTenshiKurumi-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/554/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/554/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/steel-angel-kurumi","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/88","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3199"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3200"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
