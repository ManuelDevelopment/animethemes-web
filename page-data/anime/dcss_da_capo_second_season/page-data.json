Two years ago, the island's cherry trees lost this ability and all became ordinary cherry trees that bloom only in the spring. Jun'ichi Asakura is now a graduating senior at Kazami Academy, and is surrounded by many close friends, old and new alike. On a stormy summer day, a mysterious young girl, Aisia, arrives at Jun'ichi's door. She is looking for Sakura's grandmother to study magic, ultimately hoping to bring happiness to everyone. When she discovers that grandmother Yoshino had long since passed away, she joyfully assumes (thanks to his error in judgment) that Jun'ichi is able to teach her. Even though she finally understands that the only magic he's capable of is conjuring Japanese confections, Aisia continues her search for magic on Hatsune-Jima. Amid the chaos of her search, Kazami Academy hires new medical staff.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[{"text":"D.C.S.S. ~Da Capo Second Season~"}],"series":[{"slug":"da_capo","name":"D.C.: Da Capo"}],"themes":[{"group":null,"slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Sakurairo no Kisetsu","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yozuca","name":"yozuca*"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"dcss_da_capo_second_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DaCapoS2-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Akatsuki ni Saku Uta","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"coorie","name":"CooRie"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"dcss_da_capo_second_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DaCapoS2-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]},{"episodes":"26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"DaCapoS2-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]}]},{"group":null,"slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Kioku Love Letter","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"coorie","name":"CooRie"},"as":null}]},"anime":{"slug":"dcss_da_capo_second_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"24-25","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DaCapoS2-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false,"tags":"NCBD"}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/291/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/291/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/da-capo-second-season","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/2832","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1075"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1076"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dcss_da_capo_second_season"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2288602340","2614945097","2735857046"]}
